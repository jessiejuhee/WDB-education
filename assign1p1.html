    <h3> Hermione in the Books </h3>

    <div>
        <h4> Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone </h4>
        <p>Hermione first appears in Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone when she meets Harry and Ron on the Hogwarts Express, where she mocks Ron for his inability to perform a spell to turn his rat yellow. 
            She proves just how much she knows by declaring that she memorized all the textbooks by heart. She constantly annoys her peers with her knowledge, so Harry and Ron initially consider her arrogant, 
            especially after she criticises Ron's incantation of the Levitation Charm.
            They heartily dislike her until they rescue her from a troll, for which she is so thankful that she lies to protect them from punishment, thus winning their friendship.[16] Hermione's knack for logic later 
            enables the trio to solve a puzzle that is essential to retrieving the Philosopher's Stone, and she defeats the constrictive Devil's Snare plant by summoning a jet of "bluebell flame".
            Hermione is the brains behind the plan to enter the place where the Stone is hidden. She responds to Harry's wariness of Professor Severus Snape and is also suspicious of him. She reveals to Harry and Ron that she does a lot of research in the library, which helped her defeat the Devil's Snare and work out the logic of the potions.</p>

        <h4> Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets </h4>
        <p>Hermione (along with Ron's mother Molly Weasley and a few female students of Hogwarts) develops a liking for Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher Gilderoy Lockhart as he had written all the books 
            required for the subject of Defence Against The Dark Arts in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.During a morning confrontation between the Gryffindor and Slytherin Quidditch teams, a brawl nearly 
            ensues after Draco Malfoy calls her a "Mudblood", an insulting epithet for Muggle-born wizards when she defends the Gryffindor Quidditch team. She concocts the Polyjuice Potion needed for the trio to disguise 
            themselves as Draco's housemates to collect information about the Heir of Slytherin who has reopened the Chamber of Secrets. However, she is unable to join Harry and Ron in the investigation after the hair plucked 
            from the robes of Slytherin student Millicent Bulstrode (with whom Hermione was previously matched up during Lockhart's ill-fated Duelling Club) was that of her cat, whose appearance she takes on in her human form; it takes 
            several weeks for the effects to completely wear off. Hermione is Petrified by the basilisk after successfully identifying the creature through library research. Though she lies incapacitated in the hospital wing, the information 
            she has found and left behind is crucial to Harry and Ron in their successful mission to solve the mystery of the Chamber of Secrets. Hermione is revived after Harry kills the basilisk, but she is distraught to learn that all end-of-year 
            exams have been cancelled as a school treat.</p>

    <h3> Characterisation </h3>

    <div>
        <h4> Outward Appearance </h4>
        <p> In the books, Hermione is described as having "bushy brown hair" and brown eyes.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h4> Personality </h4>
        <p> Hermione's most prominent features include her prodigious intellect and cleverness. She is levelheaded, book-smart, and always very logical. Throughout the series, Hermione uses the skills of a librarian and teacher to gather the information necessary 
            to defeat Voldemort, the "Dark Lord". When in doubt, it is to the school library that Hermione always turns.[46] She is often bossy yet unfailingly dutiful and loyal to her friends—a person who can always be counted on. J.K. Rowling stated that Hermione is a person that, 
            "never strays off the path; she always keeps her attention focused on the job that must be done."[47] Despite Hermione's intelligence and bossy attitude, Rowling says that Hermione has "quite a lot of vulnerability in her personality," as well as a "sense of insecurity underneath," 
            feels, "utterly inadequate... and to compensate, she tries and strives to be the best at everything at school, projecting a confidence that irritates people."[49] During her Defence Against the Dark Arts exam at the end of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, Hermione reveals 
            that her biggest fear is failure after a Boggart takes the form of Professor McGonagall and tells her that she has failed all her exams.
